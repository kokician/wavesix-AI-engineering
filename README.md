# 🌊 Wavesix AI Engineering

Welcome to my AI Engineering journey! This repository tracks my progress through the Wavesix AI Engineering Curriculum, a hands-on program focused on building real-world skills with cutting-edge GenAI technologies — including LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), autonomous agents, and LLMOps.


## 🧭 Curriculum Roadmap
 Each sprint builds toward the goal of engineering robust, intelligent systems powered by Large Language Models.

### 🚀 Sprint 1: LLM Foundations → Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Weeks 1–3)

- Week 1: GenAI Jumpstart – LLMs in Action, Prompt Engineering basics
- Week 2: LLM App Basics – Prompt to APIs, Embeddings, and Vector Search
- Week 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation: RAG Pipelines, Document Chunking

### 🤖 Sprint 2: Agents & Tool Use (Weeks 4–5)

- Week 4 – LLM Agents & Tool Use: LangChain, AutoGen, Tool Integration
- Week 5 – Multi-Agent Systems: Memory, Collaboration, and Coordination

### 🛡️ Sprint 3: LLMOps & Production Systems (Weeks 6–7)
- Week 6 – Observability & Guardrails: Langfuse, Helicone, Prompt Evaluation
- Week 7 – Deployment & CI/CD: Dockerization, GitHub Actions, Cloud Hosting


### 🌐 Sprint 4: Capstone – End-to-End GenAI System (Week 8)
- Final Project: A full-stack, production-ready, multi-agent GenAI system

## 📈 Weekly Progress

Each sprint folder contains a README.md with:

- ✅ Goals & Deliverables

- 💡 Key Learnings

- 🧪 Experiments & Outputs

- 🔗 Links to code, notebooks, and APIs 


## 🧠 About the Project
 This curriculum is more than theory — it's a practical, project-based deep dive into modern AI systems. By the end of the 8 weeks, I aim to have built and deployed an end-to-end, agent-powered GenAI application ready for real-world use.
